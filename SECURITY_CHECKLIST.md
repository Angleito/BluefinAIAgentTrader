# Bluefin API Security Checklist

This checklist provides guidance on securing your Bluefin API integration. Following these best practices will help protect your trading account and funds.

## Initial Setup

- [ ] **Use a dedicated email** for your Bluefin account that is not used elsewhere
- [ ] **Enable 2FA** on your Bluefin account if available
- [ ] **Create a strong password** that is unique to your Bluefin account
- [ ] **Use a password manager** to generate and store your credentials securely

## API Key Management

- [ ] **Create dedicated API keys** for each application or environment
- [ ] **Set appropriate permissions** for each API key (read-only when possible)
- [ ] **Restrict IP addresses** for API access if supported by Bluefin
- [ ] **Set up key rotation schedule** (every 30-90 days)
- [ ] **Document key creation dates** to track when they need to be rotated
- [ ] **Revoke unused keys** immediately when no longer needed

## Environment Variables

- [ ] **Store API keys in environment variables** or a secure vault, never in code
- [ ] **Use a `.env` file** with restricted permissions (`chmod 600 .env`)
- [ ] **Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`** file to prevent accidental commits
- [ ] **Verify environment variables** are loaded correctly before making API calls
- [ ] **Have fallback error handling** for missing environment variables

## Development Practices

- [ ] **Start with testnet** for all development and testing
- [ ] **Use separate keys** for testnet and mainnet environments
- [ ] **Implement circuit breakers** to stop trading in case of unusual activity
- [ ] **Set trading limits** in your code to prevent excessive positions
- [ ] **Add logging** for all API interactions without exposing sensitive data
- [ ] **Implement proper error handling** for authentication failures

## Deployment Security

- [ ] **Use a secure hosting environment** with restricted access
- [ ] **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- [ ] **Implement network-level security** (firewalls, VPNs) for production systems
- [ ] **Use a secrets manager** for production deployments
- [ ] **Regularly update** all dependencies and libraries
- [ ] **Scan for vulnerabilities** in your codebase and dependencies

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- [ ] **Set up alerts** for unusual trading activity or authentication failures
- [ ] **Monitor API usage** to detect unauthorized access
- [ ] **Create an incident response plan** for potential security breaches
- [ ] **Regularly audit** trading logs and account activity
- [ ] **Have a procedure** to quickly revoke compromised API keys
- [ ] **Test your security measures** regularly with simulated incidents

## Risk Management

- [ ] **Start with small position sizes** when moving to mainnet
- [ ] **Implement stop-loss mechanisms** independent of your main trading logic
- [ ] **Set maximum drawdown limits** to prevent catastrophic losses
- [ ] **Use timeouts and retry limits** for API calls to prevent hanging processes
- [ ] **Have a manual override procedure** to stop automated trading in emergencies
- [ ] **Regularly backup** your trading configuration and historical data

## Regular Security Reviews

- [ ] **Schedule quarterly reviews** of your security practices
- [ ] **Update this checklist** based on new threats or best practices
- [ ] **Stay informed** about security updates from Bluefin
- [ ] **Review account permissions** and API key access regularly
- [ ] **Test your connection** with `test_bluefin_connection.py` after any changes

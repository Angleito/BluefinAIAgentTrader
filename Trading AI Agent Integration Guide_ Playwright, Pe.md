# Trading AI Agent Integration Guide: Playwright, Perplexity \& TradingView

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to building a trading AI agent that leverages Playwright for chart analysis and screenshots, integrates with Perplexity AI for market research, and processes TradingView webhooks—all orchestrated through a server running on your local machine with Docker for public accessibility.

## System Architecture Overview

The architecture establishes a server on your local machine that serves as a central hub, orchestrating communication between:

1. **TradingView alerts** - sending trading signals via webhooks
2. **Playwright** - automating browser interactions to capture chart screenshots
3. **Perplexity AI** - analyzing market data and screenshot information
4. **Local server** - processing all inputs and coordinating the workflow

This integration allows for more informed trading decisions based on multiple data points and analysis methodologies.

## Setting Up a Local Server for Webhook Reception

### Flask Server Implementation

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json  # Get the JSON data from TradingView
    print("Received alert:", data)
    
    # Extract relevant information from the webhook
    ticker = data.get("ticker")
    price = data.get("price")
    
    # Trigger subsequent processes (Playwright screenshots, Perplexity analysis)
    # This is where you'll add code to initiate your workflow
    
    return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```


## Docker-Based Solutions for Public Server Access

Instead of using ngrok, you can leverage Docker to make your server publicly accessible.

### Docker Container with Port Publishing

The simplest approach is to use Docker's port publishing feature to expose your Flask application:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install Playwright and dependencies
RUN pip install playwright flask requests
RUN playwright install chromium
RUN playwright install-deps

COPY . /app/

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "server.py"]
```

Run with port publishing to make it accessible:

```bash
docker build -t trading-ai-agent .
docker run -d -p 80:5000 trading-ai-agent
```





## Implementing Playwright for Automated Chart Analysis

Playwright provides powerful capabilities for automating browser interactions and capturing trading charts:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def capture_chart_screenshot(ticker, timeframe="1D"):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Navigate to TradingView chart for the specified ticker
        page.goto(f"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol={ticker}")
        
        # Wait for chart to load completely
        page.wait_for_selector(".chart-container")
        
        # Capture screenshot
        screenshot_path = f"./screenshots/{ticker}_{timeframe}_{get_timestamp()}.png"
        page.screenshot(path=screenshot_path)
        browser.close()
        
        return screenshot_path

def get_timestamp():
    from datetime import datetime
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
```


## Integrating Perplexity AI for Market Analysis

Perplexity can analyze chart screenshots and market data to provide sophisticated insights:

```python
import requests
import base64

def analyze_chart_with_perplexity(screenshot_path, ticker, additional_context=None):
    # Convert image to base64 for transmission
    with open(screenshot_path, "rb") as image_file:
        encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
    
    # Construct prompt with image and context
    prompt = {
        "model": "sonar-reasoning",  # Using the deep seek R1 model
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Analyze this trading chart for {ticker}. What are the key technical indicators, support/resistance levels, and potential trade setups? {additional_context or ''}",
                "images": [encoded_image]
            }
        ]
    }
    
    # Send to Perplexity API (implementation details would depend on their specific API)
    response = requests.post("https://api.perplexity.ai/analyze", json=prompt)
    
    # Process response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        analysis = response.json()
        return analysis
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None
```


## Configuring TradingView Webhooks

To initiate your integrated workflow, configure TradingView to send alerts to your server:

1. Navigate to the chart where you want to create an alert
2. Click the Alarm Clock icon to create a new alert
3. Set up the condition for triggering the alert
4. In the "Webhook URL" field, enter your server URL (e.g., https://your-domain.com/webhook)
5. In the "Message" field, structure your data in JSON format:
```json
{
  "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
  "price": "{{close}}",
  "alert_type": "buy_signal",
  "timeframe": "1h"
}
```

6. Click "Create" to save the alert

## Creating the Complete Integrated Workflow

Integrating all components into a cohesive workflow:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
import requests
import json
import base64
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    # Step 1: Receive and parse webhook data
    data = request.json
    print(f"Received alert for {data.get('ticker')} at {data.get('price')}")
    
    # Step 2: Capture chart screenshot using Playwright
    screenshot_path = capture_chart_screenshot(data.get('ticker'))
    
    # Step 3: Get additional market context from TradingView
    market_context = get_market_context(data.get('ticker'))
    
    # Step 4: Analyze chart with Perplexity
    analysis = analyze_chart_with_perplexity(
        screenshot_path, 
        data.get('ticker'), 
        additional_context=market_context
    )
    
    # Step 5: Compile comprehensive report
    report = compile_trading_report(data, analysis, market_context)
    
    # Step 6: Save report and optionally email it
    save_and_distribute_report(report, data.get('ticker'))
    
    return jsonify({"status": "completed", "report_generated": True}), 200

def capture_chart_screenshot(ticker):
    # Implementation as shown earlier
    pass

def get_market_context(ticker):
    # Fetch fundamental data, news, or other context
    pass

def analyze_chart_with_perplexity(screenshot_path, ticker, additional_context):
    # Implementation as shown earlier
    pass

def compile_trading_report(webhook_data, perplexity_analysis, market_context):
    # Combine all data sources into a comprehensive report
    pass

def save_and_distribute_report(report, ticker):
    # Save report to file system and optionally email to user
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

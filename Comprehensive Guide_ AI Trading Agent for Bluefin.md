# Comprehensive Guide: AI Trading Agent for Bluefin on Sui Network

This document outlines the specifications, requirements, and best practices for developing an AI trading agent that utilizes the Bluefin Exchange on Sui network, integrating with TradingView for technical analysis signals.

## Project Overview

The AI trading agent will autonomously execute trades on Bluefin Exchange based on signals received from TradingView webhooks. This agent will replace the Interactive Brokers implementation in the original repository with Bluefin's decentralized trading functionality, allowing for perpetual derivatives trading on the Sui blockchain.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

The system consists of four primary components:

1. Bluefin Exchange API integration for order execution and account management
2. TradingView webhook listener for receiving trading signals
3. AI decision-making engine powered by Claude Sonnet 3.7
4. Performance tracking and logging system

### Required Dependencies

```
pip install bluefin_client_sui perplexity-python fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-dotenv
```


## Code Requirements

All code developed for this project must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Code Brevity**: Write concise code that accomplishes tasks in the minimum number of lines without sacrificing readability or functionality. Prioritize efficient implementations.
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Include detailed comments explaining:
    - Function purpose and operation
    - Parameter definitions
    - Trading logic reasoning
    - Risk management controls
    - Edge cases and exception handling
3. **Expert-Level Implementation**: Code should reflect best practices from both software engineering and technical trading disciplines.
4. **Modularity**: Structure code into discrete, reusable components that each handle a specific aspect of the system.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error detection and recovery mechanisms to prevent catastrophic failures during trading operations.

## Trading Parameters

The agent will operate with the following default trading parameters, all of which should be configurable:

1. **Position Sizing**: 5% of total portfolio value (measured in wUSDC on Bluefin)
2. **Leverage**: 7x for all positions
3. **Stop Loss**: 15% below entry price for long positions, 15% above entry price for short positions
4. **Take Profit**: Dynamic, based on risk-reward ratio (configurable)
5. **Maximum Concurrent Positions**: Configurable, default 3
6. **Trading Pairs**: Initially BTC, ETH, SOL and SUI perpetual markets

## Bluefin Integration

The agent will use the Bluefin Python client to interact with the exchange:

```python
from bluefin_client_sui import BluefinClient, Networks

async def initialize_bluefin_client(private_key, network_choice="SUI_PROD"):
    # Initialize Bluefin client with proper credentials
    client = BluefinClient(
        True,  # Agree to terms and conditions
        Networks[network_choice],  # Network selection
        private_key  # Private key for authentication
    )
    # Initialize client with onboarding set to True for first-time use
    await client.init(True)
    return client
```


## TradingView Integration

The agent will listen for webhook notifications from TradingView containing signal data:

1. Signal type (buy/sell)
2. Symbol (trading pair)
3. Timeframe
4. Indicator values
5. Confidence level

## Performance Tracking

The agent must maintain detailed logs of all trading activity:

1. Entry and exit timestamps
2. Entry and exit prices
3. Position size
4. P\&L for each trade (both absolute and percentage)
5. Cumulative P\&L
6. Drawdown metrics
7. Win/loss ratio

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Environment Configuration**: Store all sensitive information (private keys, API endpoints) in environment variables.
2. **Webhook Handler**:

```python
@app.post("/webhook")
async def tradingview_webhook(signal: SignalModel):
    # Process incoming signal from TradingView
    # Make trading decision based on signal parameters
    # Execute trade via Bluefin client if conditions are met
```

3. **Position Management**:

```python
async def open_position(client, symbol, direction, size_percentage=0.05, leverage=7):
    # Calculate position size based on account balance
    # Set appropriate leverage
    # Execute the trade with proper risk parameters
    # Log the entry details
```

4. **Risk Management**:

```python
async def set_stop_loss(client, position, entry_price, direction, percentage=0.15):
    # Calculate stop loss price based on entry and direction
    # Submit stop loss order to Bluefin
    # Log the risk management details
```


## Development Workflow

1. Begin by implementing the core Bluefin client integration and basic webhook listener
2. Add position sizing and order execution functionality
3. Implement risk management features (stop loss, take profit)
4. Add performance tracking and logging
5. Develop AI decision logic for trade evaluation
6. Create configuration interface for adjusting parameters
7. Implement comprehensive testing with simulated signals

## Git Management

1. Initialize repository with basic README, LICENSE, and .gitignore
2. Commit after each functional component is implemented
3. Use descriptive commit messages explaining the purpose and functionality added
4. Create branches for experimental features
5. Tag releases with semantic versioning

# Claude API Documentation: A Comprehensive Guide

The Anthropic Claude API provides developers with access to Claude, a family of state-of-the-art large language models capable of understanding and generating text, analyzing images, and performing complex reasoning tasks. This report provides a detailed overview of the Claude API documentation, covering key aspects from initial setup to advanced features.

## Introduction to Claude API

Anthropic's Claude API offers programmatic access to the Claude family of AI models, enabling developers to integrate Claude's capabilities into their applications. The API documentation is structured to guide users through various stages of development, from basic setup to advanced implementations. Claude can assist with numerous tasks involving text, code, and images, including summarization, question answering, data extraction, translation, code explanation, and code generation[^1]. The documentation provides comprehensive guidance on these capabilities, ensuring developers can fully leverage Claude's potential across different use cases.

The documentation is organized into several major sections, including getting started guides, model information, building with Claude, agents and tools, testing and evaluation resources, and administrative documentation. This structure helps developers navigate the extensive documentation based on their specific needs and development stage. As Claude continues to evolve with new features and model versions, the documentation is regularly updated to reflect these changes and provide developers with the most current information[^2].

## Getting Started with the Claude API

The initial setup documentation provides a straightforward path for developers to begin using the Claude API. Every API call requires a valid API key, which can be supplied either through an environmental variable called `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or directly when initializing the Anthropic client[^5]. This flexibility allows developers to choose the approach that best fits their security and deployment requirements.

The documentation includes quickstart guides that demonstrate how to develop basic but functional Claude-powered applications using the Console, Workbench, and API[^5]. These guides typically include code examples showing how to make API calls by passing the proper parameters to the /messages endpoint, which is the primary way to interact with Claude models[^3]. The examples are provided in multiple programming languages, making it easier for developers to implement Claude in their preferred environment.

After completing the initial setup, developers are directed to additional resources, including use case guides, the Anthropic Cookbook (containing interactive Jupyter notebooks), and a prompt library with dozens of example prompts for inspiration across different use cases[^5]. These resources help developers move beyond basic implementation to more sophisticated applications of Claude's capabilities.

## API Features and Capabilities

The Claude API offers a rich set of features and capabilities that extend beyond basic text generation. The documentation extensively covers these features to help developers implement them effectively in their applications.

### Messages API

The Messages API is the core interface for interacting with Claude models. It allows developers to create conversations with alternating user and assistant turns. When creating a new message, developers specify prior conversational turns with the messages parameter, and the model generates the next message in the conversation[^3].

Each input message must include a role (either "user" or "assistant") and content. Developers can specify a single user-role message or include multiple user and assistant messages, with the first message always using the user role[^3]. The Messages API also supports prefilling the response from Claude by including a final assistant role message, allowing developers to constrain part of the model's response.

### System Prompts

System prompts provide a way to give Claude context and instructions, such as specifying a particular goal or role. These prompts are specified in the `system` field of the request and help shape Claude's responses to better align with the developer's intended use case[^3]. For example, a system prompt might define Claude as an AI assistant created to be helpful, harmless, and honest, with the goal of providing informative and substantive responses while avoiding potential harms.

### Multimodal Capabilities

Claude supports multimodal prompts that combine multiple modalities (images and text) in a single interaction. Developers specify these modalities in the `content` input field of their requests[^3]. This capability enables use cases such as asking Claude to describe the content of supplied images, analyze charts and graphs, or interpret visual information in conjunction with textual queries.

The documentation notes certain restrictions for multimodal content, including limits on the number and size of images (up to 20 images, each no larger than 3.75 MB, 8,000 px height, and 8,000 px width) and documents (up to five documents, each no larger than 4.5 MB)[^3]. These guidelines help developers design their applications within the technical constraints of the API.

### Tool Use (Function Calling)

The Claude API supports tools and function calling to enhance the model's capabilities. This feature allows Claude to interact with external tools or functions to perform actions beyond its native abilities[^4]. The documentation includes examples of how to use tools, such as searching for nearby restaurants that are open, demonstrating the practical applications of this feature for creating more interactive and capable applications.

## Available Claude Models

The Claude API documentation provides detailed information about the various models available through the API, helping developers choose the most appropriate model for their specific use cases, performance requirements, and budget considerations.

### Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is described as Anthropic's most intelligent model to date and the first Claude model to offer extended thinking—the ability to solve complex problems with careful, step-by-step reasoning[^4][^6]. It is a single model where developers can balance speed and quality by choosing between standard thinking for near-instant responses or extended thinking for advanced reasoning. This model is particularly optimized for agentic coding, customer-facing agents, computer use, content generation and analysis, and visual data extraction[^4].

### Claude 3.5 Haiku

Claude 3.5 Haiku is positioned as Anthropic's fastest model[^6]. It supports both text and image input with text output and offers a 200k context window[^6]. The model was updated to include vision support, enabling it to analyze and understand images[^2]. This model is ideal for applications where response speed is critical.

### Other Models

The documentation also references other models in the Claude family, including Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet[^4]. Each model has specific capabilities, context window limits, and performance characteristics detailed in the documentation to help developers select the most appropriate option for their needs.

## Integration Options

The Claude API documentation covers multiple integration options, allowing developers to access Claude models through various platforms and services.

### Anthropic SDKs

Anthropic provides official SDKs for various programming languages to simplify integration with the Claude API. These SDKs handle authentication, request formatting, and response parsing, making it easier for developers to implement Claude in their applications[^4][^5]. The documentation includes examples of how to use these SDKs for both streaming and non-streaming (unary) calls to Claude models.

### AWS Bedrock Integration

Claude models are available through Amazon Bedrock, allowing AWS users to access Claude capabilities within their existing AWS infrastructure[^3]. The documentation provides specific information on how to use the Claude Messages API with AWS Bedrock's base inference operations (InvokeModel or InvokeModelWithResponseStream), including code examples and parameter specifications.

### Google Vertex AI Integration

Anthropic's Claude models are also available through Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform[^4]. The documentation specifies the model names to use when accessing Claude through Vertex AI (e.g., `claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219` for Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and provides code samples for making API requests using the Anthropic Vertex SDK.

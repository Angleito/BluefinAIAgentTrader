# PerplexityTrader Implementation Checklist

This document verifies that all functionality described in the README is properly implemented in the codebase.

## Core Components

| Component | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Bluefin Client Interface | ✅ | `agent.py` - MockBluefinClient and real client implementations | Both SUI and V2 client support with fallbacks |
| Chart Analysis System | ✅ | `agent.py`, `core/chart_analyzer.py` | Uses both Claude and Perplexity |
| Alert Processing System | ✅ | `agent.py` - process_alerts() | Monitors alerts directory |
| Risk Management System | ✅ | `agent.py` - RiskManager class | Position sizing and risk parameters |
| API Server | ✅ | `agent.py` - FastAPI implementation | Status endpoints available |

## Installation Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Python 3.8+ | ✅ | `Dockerfile` uses Python 3.10 | Compatible with requirements |
| Playwright | ✅ | `requirements.txt` and installation in Dockerfile | Used for chart screenshots |
| Docker Support | ✅ | `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` | Complete container setup |
| Environment Variables | ✅ | `.env.example` | All required variables included |

## Configuration Options

| Option | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|
| API Keys | ✅ | Environment variables in `.env.example` | All API keys properly documented |
| Trading Parameters | ✅ | `config.py` | Extensive configuration options |
| Risk Parameters | ✅ | `config.py` | Risk management settings available |
| Mock Trading Toggle | ✅ | Environment variable in `.env.example` | Can switch between mock/real trading |

## Trading Functionality

| Feature | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Chart Screenshot Capture | ✅ | `agent.py` - capture_chart_screenshot() | Uses Playwright |
| Claude Chart Analysis | ✅ | `agent.py` - analyze_chart_with_claude() | Extracts trading recommendations |
| Perplexity Analysis | ✅ | `core/perplexity_client.py`, `core/chart_analyzer.py` | Used as fallback and confirmation |
| Alert Processing | ✅ | `agent.py` - process_alerts() | Handles different alert types |
| Trade Execution | ✅ | `agent.py` - execute_trade() | Supports different order types |
| Position Management | ✅ | `agent.py` - manage_trade() | Monitors and adjusts positions |

## Missing or Incomplete Features

1. **Documentation Images**: The README references an architecture diagram placeholder that should be replaced with an actual image.

2. **Project Structure**: The README describes a clean project structure, but the actual codebase has many additional files not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Alert Examples**: While the README mentions alert file formats, there could be more example files in the alerts directory.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Code Organization**: Move more functionality to the core/ directory for better separation of concerns.

2. **Tests**: Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests for critical components.

3. **Error Handling**: Further improve error handling in API calls and chart analysis.

4. **Logging**: Enhance logging with more structured formats and levels.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Add more sophisticated rate limiting for API calls.

6. **Documentation**: Add inline documentation to explain complex trading logic.

7. **Configuration Validation**: Add validation for configuration parameters.

## Conclusion

The codebase implements all the major functionality described in the README. The system is well-designed with multiple fallback mechanisms and error recovery, making it resilient to failures. The mock trading mode provides a safe way to test strategies before using real funds.

Some minor improvements could be made to better align the codebase with the ideal structure described in the README, but these are not critical to the functionality of the system.
